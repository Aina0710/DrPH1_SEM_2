# Introduction
Multinomial logistic regression is a statistical method used to model relationships between a polytomous (i.e., having more than two categories) nominal outcome variable and one or more independent variables. Unlike binary logistic regression, which is limited to dichotomous outcomes, multinomial logistic regression accommodates outcome variables with three or more unordered categories. This method estimates the probability of each category relative to a reference group by fitting a series of binary logistic regressions, producing a set of coefficients that reflect the log-odds of membership in each non-reference category. It is particularly useful in public health and epidemiological research where outcomes such as disease classification, behavioral responses, or clinical stages are categorized without a natural ordering. The model can incorporate both continuous and categorical predictors, enabling comprehensive analysis of complex associations within population health datasets.

# Load the dataset
```{r}
data<- read_csv("datamssm_a.csv")
glimpse(data)
```
# Data wrangling
Change character variable to factor
```{r}
data<- data %>% mutate_if(is.character, ~as_factor(.))
glimpse(data)
```
# Exploratory Data Analysis
```{r}
summary(data)
```
There are several data missing in the variable. Hence, we need to handle these missing data prior to continuing with analysis.

## Handling missing data
In this practice, we remove any row with missing data. 
```{r}
clean_data <- na.omit(data)
summary(clean_data)
```
```{r}
glimpse(clean_data)
clean_data %>% select(-codesub) %>% 
  tbl_summary(statistic = list(all_continuous()~ "{mean} ({sd})")) %>% 
  modify_caption("**Table 1:Characteristic of Participant**")
```
## Categorize fbs into 3 levels
```{r}
# Categorize FBS based on Malaysian clinical cut-offs
clean_data <- clean_data %>%
  mutate(cat_fbs = case_when(
    fbs < 5.6 ~ "Normal",
    fbs >= 5.6 & fbs <= 6.9 ~ "Prediabetes",
    TRUE ~ "Diabetes")) %>%
  mutate(cat_fbs = factor(cat_fbs, levels = c("Normal", "Prediabetes", "Diabetes")))

# Check result
table(clean_data$cat_fbs)

```
## Checking level of cat_fbs
```{r}
levels(clean_data$cat_fbs)
```
## Re-level for cat_fbs
We will use VGAM package for further multinomial analysis. As the packages compare biggest value to the lowest, we need to rearrage the level of cat_fbs. We will make "Normal" as the reference category.
```{r}
clean_data<- clean_data %>% 
  mutate(cat_fbs2 = fct_relevel(cat_fbs,
                                c("Diabetes", "Prediabetes", "Normal")))

# compare the data
summary(clean_data$cat_fbs); summary(clean_data$cat_fbs2)
```
```{r}
# recheck releveling
levels(clean_data$cat_fbs2)
```
# Multinomial analysis using VGAM packages
We will be using VGAM packages to run multinomial logistic regression. The model that we want to estimate for are:

1. group 1 vs group 3: Diabetes vs Normal
2. group 2 vs group 3: Prediabetes vs Normal

The reference group here, is Normal group.
```{r}
library(VGAM)
```
## Model with univariable
### Gender
```{r}
mod1<- vglm(cat_fbs2~ gender, multinomial, data = clean_data)
summary(mod1)
```
Intercept 1: 
The log-odds of being diabetic versus normal for females (reference category) is -2.13590, which is statistically significant (p < 0.001). This negative value indicates that females are less likely to be diabetic compared to having normal fasting blood sugar levels.

Intercept 2: 
The log-odds of being prediabetic versus normal for females (reference category) is -1.29294, which is significant (p < 0.001). This negative value indicates that females are less likely to be prediabetic than to have normal fasting blood sugar levels.

gendermale:1: 
For diabetes vs. normal, the log-odds for males is 0.07934 (p = 0.535), indicating no significant difference between genders for the likelihood of diabetes in this model.

gendermale:2: 
For prediabetes vs. normal, males have a significantly higher log-odds 0.23841  (p < 0.001) of being prediabetic than females, suggesting that men are more likely to be prediabetic compared to having normal fasting blood sugar levels.

To get odd ratio:
```{r}
exp(0.23841)
```
So, males have 1.27 times the odds of being prediabetic vs normal compared to females.

### Age
```{r}
mod2<- vglm(cat_fbs2 ~ age, multinomial, data = clean_data)
summary(mod2)
```

age:1 for outcome cat_fbs 2 = diabetes vs normal. age:1 0.030088.
Each 1-year increase in age is associated with a 3.1% increase in odds of being diabetic vs normal

age:2 for outcome cat_fbs2 = prediabetes vs normal. age:2 0.030949.
Each 1-year increase in age is associated with a 3.2% increase in odds of being prediabetic vs normal

Age is significantly associated with both diabetes and prediabetes, compared to normal FBS. For each additional year of age: 

The odds of having diabetes (vs normal FBS) increase by ~3.1%

The odds of having prediabetes (vs normal FBS) increase by ~3.2%

This indicates that older individuals are more likely to have impaired fasting blood sugar.

### Hypertension
```{r}
mod_hpt<- vglm(cat_fbs2 ~ hpt, multinomial, data = clean_data)
summary(mod_hpt)
```
Intercept 1: 
The log-odds of being diabetic vs normal for those with hypertension (reference category) is -1.3802, which is statistically significant (p < 0.001). This negative value indicates that individuals with hypertension are less likely to be diabetic compared to having normal fasting blood sugar levels.

Intercept 2: 
The log-odds of being prediabetic versus normal for those with hypertension is -0.3753, also statistically significant (p = 0.0022). This negative value suggests that those with hypertension are less likely to be prediabetic than to have normal fasting blood sugar levels.

hptno:1: 
For diabetes vs. normal, the log-odds for individuals without hypertension is -0.8068 (p < 0.001), indicating that those without hypertension have significantly lower odds of being diabetic compared to those with hypertension.

hptno:2: 
For prediabetes vs. normal, individuals without hypertension have a significantly lower log-odds of -0.9280 (p < 0.001) of being prediabetic compared to those with hypertension, suggesting that not having hypertension is associated with a reduced likelihood of being prediabetic.

To get odd ratio:
For diabetes vs normal
```{r}
exp(-0.8068)
```
Those without hypertension have significantly lower log-odds of being in the Diabetes group (vs. Normal). OR = exp(-0.8068) ≈ 0.45, meaning 55% lower odds.

For prediabetes vs normal
```{r}
exp(-0.9280)
```
Those without hypertension have significantly lower log-odds of being in the Prediabetes group (vs. Normal). OR = exp(-0.9280) ≈ 0.40, meaning 60% lower odds.

## Multivariate Model Analysis
Adding more variable into the model. We will choose variables as follows:

- age
- gender
- hpt

```{r}
mod3 <-vglm(cat_fbs2~age+gender+hpt, multinomial, data=clean_data)
summary(mod3)
```
# Multinomial analysis using NNET package
Unlike VGAM::vglm function where the reference or the base outcome in the largest group (level), the nnet::multinom usess the smallest group (level) as the references or base outcome.

## Load the packages
```{r}
library(nnet)
```
## Univariate model
Using variable age as example:

```{r}
mlog_nnet<- multinom(cat_fbs ~ age, data= clean_data)
summary(mlog_nnet)
```
## Comparing VGAM::vglm and nnet::multinom
Changing the reference category
```{r}
clean_data <- clean_data %>% 
  mutate(cat_fbs_relev= relevel(cat_fbs, ref = "Normal"))
levels(clean_data$cat_fbs_relev)
```
So, running multinom will give the following:
```{r}
mlog_nnet_relev <- multinom(cat_fbs_relev~ age, data = clean_data)
summary(mlog_nnet_relev)
```
And running vglm, we will get this:
```{r}
summary(mod2)
```
Summary:
Despite slight differences in formatting, both models are showing identical coefficient estimates for the relationship between age and the outcome cat_fbs2 (or cat_fbs_relev).

For example:
Prediabetes intercept: -2.70005
Diabetes intercept: -3.55687
age coefficient (Diabetes vs. Normal): 0.03009
age coefficient (Prediabetes vs. Normal): 0.03095

These values match perfectly, confirming both models fit the same data and are yielding the same parameter estimates.


```{r}
confint(mod2)
```

# Inferences
## Using VGAM 
### Getting the beta coefficient and confidence interval for each covariate in multivariate model (mod3)
```{r}
b_mod3 <- coef(mod3)
ci_mod3 <- confint(mod3)
cbind(b_mod3, ci_mod3)
```
The following sequences will;

- 1. return the log odds and the RRR
- 2. return the 95%CI for log odds and the CI for RRR
- 3. combine the objects into table
- 4. renaming the column

```{r}
b_rrr_mod3 <- cbind(coef(mod3), exp(coef(mod3)))
ci_b_rrr.mod3 <-cbind(confint(mod3), exp(confint(mod3)))
res_mod3<- cbind(b_rrr_mod3, ci_b_rrr.mod3)
colnames(res_mod3)<- c('b','rrr',
                       'lower 95% b', 'upper 95% b',
                       'lower 95% rrr', 'upper 95% rrr')
res_mod3
```
A better table using knitr and kableExtra packages
```{r}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```

```{r}
kable(res_mod3, digits = 3) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 
                  c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```
## Using NNET packages 
### Getting p-value and CI from nnet::multinom
```{r}
z.test<- summary(mlog_nnet_relev)$coefficients/summary(mlog_nnet_relev)$standard.errors
# 2-tailed
p.val <- (1-pnorm(abs(z.test), 0, 1))*2
library(readxl)
colnames(p.val)<- c("p-val intercept", "p-val age")
p.val
```
### CI for nnet::multinom
```{r}
confint(mlog_nnet_relev, level = 0.95)
```
# Prediction
## Predict the log odds
For model 1 (mod1) that use VGAM::vglm function previously
```{r}
summary(mod1)
```
The predicted log odds for the first 6 observations:

- The predicted log odds for diabetes vs normal group in column 1
- The predicted log odds for prediabetes vs normal group in column 2

```{r}
head(predict.vgam(mod1, type = 'link'))
```
We can verify these prediction manually. For example the calculation for:

1. the 1st observation log odds
2. the 4th observation log odds

```{r}
clean_data %>%
  head(20) %>%  # Show only first 20 rows (adjust as needed)
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "300px")

```
The value for the
- 1st observation are gender = female, 0
- 4th observation are gender = male, 1
```{r}
# Patient 1, gender= female (0)
# Logit cat_fbs2= diabetes[1] vs normal [3]
-2.13590 + (0.07934*0)
```
```{r}
# Logit cat_fbs2 = prediabetes [2] vs normal [3]
-1.29294+ (0.23841*0)
```
```{r}
# Patient 4, gender male (1)
# Logit cat_fbs2 = diabetes [1] vs normal [3]
-2.13590 + (0.07934*1)
```
```{r}
# Logit cat_fbs2 = prediabetes [2] vs normal [3]
-1.29294+ (0.23841*1)
```
## Predict the probability
The predicted probability for the first 6 observation
```{r}
head(predict.vgam(mod1, type = 'response'))
```
Manual calculation for probability. Let us take the first observation where,

1. log odds for group diabetes = -2.13590
2. log odds for group prediabetes = -1.29294

```{r}
# Probability being in the reference group, cat_fbs2 = Normal [3]
1/(1+ exp(-2.13590)+ exp(-1.29294))
```
```{r}
# Probability being in the prediabetes group, cat_fbs2 = Prediabetes [2]
exp(-1.29294)/ (1+ exp(-2.13590)+ exp(-1.29294))
```
```{r}
# Probability being in the diabetes group, cat_fbs2 = Diabaetes [1]
exp(-2.13590)/ (1+ exp(-2.13590)+ exp(-1.29294))
```
# Interpretation
Using multivariate model with age, gender and hypertension as independent variables.

```{r}
mod4 <- vglm(cat_fbs2 ~ age+gender+ hpt, family = multinomial, data = clean_data)
summary(mod4)
```
1.Age
For each one-year increase in age, the odds of being diabetic (vs. normal) increase by about 2.8% (OR ≈ 1.03, p < 0.001). Similarly, each year of age increases the odds of being prediabetic (vs. normal) by about 2.8% (OR ≈ 1.03, p < 0.001). This shows that age is a significant factor that increases the risk of abnormal fasting blood sugar levels.

2. Gender (Male vs. Female)
There is no significant difference between males and females in the odds of being diabetic (p = 0.625). However, males have significantly higher odds of being prediabetic compared to females (OR ≈ 1.25, p = 0.011), suggesting that men are more likely to be prediabetic.

3. Hypertension (No vs. Yes)
Individuals without hypertension have significantly lower odds of being diabetic (vs. normal), with an odds ratio of about 0.60 (p = 0.0086). They also have lower odds of being prediabetic (OR ≈ 0.53, p < 0.001). This suggests that not having hypertension is associated with a lower risk of abnormal fasting blood sugar levels.

Overall, these findings highlight that age and hypertension status are important predictors of fasting blood sugar categories, with gender playing a role in prediabetes risk.
